## Key Features

### 1. ASI1 LLM Integration

The agent uses ASI1 LLM to enhance all responses with natural language understanding:

**Technical Response (Before ASI1):**
```
Bitcoin (BTC)
Price: $43,250.00
24h Change: +2.45% ↑
Market Cap: $846.5B
```

**Enhanced Response (After ASI1):**
```
Great news! Bitcoin is showing strong momentum today, trading at $43,250 
with a solid 2.45% gain over the last 24 hours. With a market cap of 
$846.5B, BTC continues to dominate the crypto market. This upward 
movement suggests renewed investor confidence. Consider this a positive 
signal if you're looking at entry points, though always remember to 
assess your risk tolerance first.
```

**Implementation Features:**
- Context-aware response refinement
- Professional yet conversational tone
- Actionable insights embedded in responses
- Query understanding and disambiguation
- Natural language flow

### 2. Metta Knowledge Graph Integration

Metta provides symbolic reasoning and contextual understanding for cryptocurrency queries:

; Define major cryptocurrencies
(= (cryptocurrency bitcoin) True)
(= (cryptocurrency ethereum) True)
(= (cryptocurrency solana) True)

; Use cases
(: use-case Type)
(: has-use-case (-> cryptocurrency use-case))
(= (has-use-case bitcoin) store-of-value)
(= (has-use-case ethereum) smart-contracts)
(= (has-use-case solana) high-throughput)

; Risk levels
(: risk-level Type)
(: has-risk (-> cryptocurrency risk-level))
(= (has-risk bitcoin) low)
(= (has-risk ethereum) medium)
(= (has-risk solana) high)
```

**Metta Capabilities:**
- Symbolic reasoning about cryptocurrency relationships
- Use case identification and explanation
- Risk level assessment based on knowledge base
- Contextual query understanding
- Cross-reference validation

**Example Query Flow:**
```
User: "Tell me about Ethereum"
↓
Metta Query: !(has-use-case ethereum)
↓
Metta Result: "smart-contracts"
↓
ASI1 Enhancement: "Ethereum is the leading platform for smart contracts 
and decentralized applications. Its blockchain enables programmable 
transactions, making it the foundation for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 
applications. With a medium risk profile, Ethereum is ideal for investors 
seeking exposure to blockchain innovation beyond simple value storage."

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries

**Price Check:**
```
User: "What's the Bitcoin price?"

Response: Great question! Bitcoin is currently trading at $43,250.00, 
showing a healthy 2.45% gain over the last 24 hours. The market cap 
stands at $846.5B, maintaining its position as the dominant cryptocurrency. 
With 24-hour trading volume at $28.3B, there's strong liquidity and 
investor interest. This upward movement is a positive signal for the 
broader crypto market.
```

**Multiple Tokens:**
```
User: "Show me BTC and ETH prices"

Response: 
Bitcoin (BTC) is leading the charge at $43,250 with a +2.45% gain, 
backed by a massive $846.5B market cap. The king of crypto continues 
to set the pace.

Ethereum (ETH) is performing well at $2,280, up +1.87% in the last 24 
hours. With a market cap of $274.2B and its role as the smart contract 
leader, ETH remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem.

Both assets are showing positive momentum, suggesting market confidence 
is building.
```

### Market Intelligence

**Trending Analysis:**
```
User: "What's trending in crypto?"

Response: Here are the hottest cryptocurrencies right now based on 
search volume and interest:

1. Solana (SOL) - Rank #5
   The high-performance blockchain is seeing massive interest due to 
   recent ecosystem growth and NFT activity.

2. Avalanche (AVAX) - Rank #12
   Building momentum with new partnerships and DeFi innovations.

3. Chainlink (LINK) - Rank #14
   Oracle solutions driving sustained interest from institutional players.

Metta Knowledge: Analyzed major cryptocurrencies in knowledge base
```

**News with Sentiment:**
```
User: "Latest crypto news"

Response: 
Here's what's making waves in the crypto world:

1. "Bitcoin ETF Approval Moves Closer as SEC Reviews Applications"
   Source: CoinDesk | Sentiment: BULLISH
   
   This is significant news that could open the floodgates for 
   institutional investment. ETF approval would make Bitcoin more 
   accessible to traditional investors and could drive substantial 
   price appreciation.

2. "Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions Hit Record Transaction Volumes"
   Source: CoinTelegraph | Sentiment: BULLISH
   
   Layer 2 scaling is finally delivering on its promise, making 
   Ethereum more practical for everyday use. This addresses one of 
   ETH's biggest challenges and strengthens its position as the 
   leading smart contract platform.

[... continues with more analyzed news]
```

### Investment Strategies

**Risk-Based Recommendations:**
```
User: "Give me a medium-risk investment strategy"

Response:
MEDIUM-RISK BALANCED STRATEGY

For investors seeking growth while managing volatility, here's a 
well-balanced approach:

ALLOCATION:
• 30% Bitcoin (BTC) - Your foundation and stability anchor
• 25% Ethereum (ETH) - Smart contract exposure and innovation
• 25% Top 10 Altcoins - Diversified growth potential (SOL, ADA, DOT)
• 15% DeFi Tokens - Access to decentralized finance upside (UNI, AAVE)
• 5% Stablecoins - Liquidity buffer for opportunities

INVESTMENT APPROACH:
This strategy balances proven assets with emerging opportunities. 
The 55% allocation to BTC and ETH provides stability, while the 
altcoin and DeFi positions offer growth potential. Monthly rebalancing 
helps maintain your target allocation as prices fluctuate.

TIME HORIZON: 6-12 months
EXPECTED RETURN: 15-30% annually
RISK PROFILE: Moderate volatility with diversified growth focus

Remember: This is a general framework. Adjust based on your specific 
circumstances, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Always conduct 
your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor.
