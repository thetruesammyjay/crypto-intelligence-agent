## Installation and Configuration

### System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- Network connectivity for external API access
- Minimum 512MB RAM (1GB recommended)
- 500MB available disk space

### Installation Procedure

1. **Repository Setup**
```bash
git clone github.com/thetruesammyjay/crypto-intelligence-agent
cd crypto-intelligence-agent
```

2. **Dependency Installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements-extra.txt
```


3. **Natural Language Processing Data**
```bash
python scripts/download_nltk_data.py
```

4. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure the `AGENT_SEED` parameter with a cryptographically secure random string (minimum 32 characters recommended). This seed is used for deterministic agent address generation.

- Protocol listener confirmation

### Protocol Interface

The agent implements the ASI:ONE chat protocol for message-based communication. Client applications interact via `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` message models:

```python
from agents.protocols import ChatRequest, ChatResponse

# Protocol message structure
request = ChatRequest(
    message="What's the price of Bitcoin?",
    user_id="optional_user_identifier",
    session_id="optional_session_identifier"
)
```

### Query Classification

The system employs natural language understanding to classify queries into the following categories:

**Price Information Queries**
- Token price retrieval
- Market capitalization data
- 24-hour trading volume
- Price change percentages

**News and Information Queries**
- Aggregated cryptocurrency news
- Token-specific news filtering
- Sentiment-analyzed article feeds

**Market Analysis Queries**
- Top performing assets (gainers)
- Worst performing assets (losers)
- Trending token identification
- Volume-based rankings

**Investment Strategy Queries**
- Staking opportunity analysis
- DeFi protocol recommendations
- Portfolio diversification strategies
- Risk-adjusted allocation models

**Comparative Analysis Queries**
- Multi-token metric comparison
- Performance differential analysis
- Market position evaluation

AGENT_SEED=<minimum-32-character-random-string>

# Agent Network Configuration
AGENT_NAME=crypto_intelligence_agent
AGENT_PORT=8000
AGENT_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000
```

### Feature Toggle Configuration

- Token use case taxonomies and technical specifications
- Cryptocurrency domain terminology and keyword mappings

## Testing and Validation

### Test Suite Execution

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The test suite includes unit tests for all service modules, intelligence components, and utility functions. Tests validate:
- API integration correctness
- Data model validation
- Caching behavior
- Rate limiting mechanisms
- Error handling paths

### Component-Level Testing

```bash
# Price service integration tests
python -m services.price_service

# News aggregation tests
python -m services.news_service

# Trending analysis tests
python -m services.trending_service
```

### API Connectivity Validation

```bash
python scripts/test_apis.py
```

This script performs end-to-end validation of all external API dependencies and reports connectivity status, latency metrics, and data integrity.

## Security Considerations

### Operational Security

1. **Environment Variable Protection**: Never commit `.env` files to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive configuration.
2. **Seed Entropy**: Generate `AGENT_SEED` using cryptographically secure random number generators with minimum 256-bit entropy.
3. **Agent Address Privacy**: Treat agent addresses as sensitive identifiers. Implement access controls for production deployments.
4. **Dependency Management**: Maintain regular dependency updates. Monitor security advisories for Python packages.
5. **Log Monitoring**: Implement automated log analysis for anomaly detection and unauthorized access attempts.

### Input Validation

All user inputs undergo validation through Pydantic models before processing. This prevents injection attacks and ensures type safety throughout the application stack.

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Strategies

- **Asynchronous I/O**: All network operations utilize Python's asyncio for non-blocking execution, enabling concurrent request processing.
- **Multi-Tier Caching**: Implements LRU cache eviction with configurable TTL policies. Cache hit rates typically exceed 80% under normal operation.
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm prevents API throttling while maximizing throughput within provider limits.
- **Connection Pooling**: HTTP session reuse reduces connection overhead by approximately 60%.
- **Memory Management**: Bounded cache sizes and sliding window context management ensure predictable memory footprint.
